(Most of scripts not mine)

-How to use Koala Hub?
-First you need a executor, i recommend use paid executors, because in free executors you will need a key every 24h/48h. 
-What free executor best? 
-Krnl (Runs ~90% of scripts, but updating too long and have 24h key system). 
-What paid executors best?
-Synapse (Most recommend, runs all scripts, keyless, cost 15-20$ (15$ only with crypto)), Sentinel (Runs ~95% of scripts, keyless, cost 15$). (i not recommend because: others exploit not popular | updating too long | just closed)
-Can i use my own executor?
-Yes, but if you not designer it will look so ugly.
